Attempting to solve Sudoku puzzles with three separate AIs

I've always been a fan of Sudoku. That grid puzzle captivated me when I came across one when I was a teenager, and since then solving Sudoku puzzles has become one of my favorite activities to pass the time, especially on the plane. 

When Covid hit, I lost my livelihood as a touring musician and eventually decided to learn coding. A few weeks later, with what I have learnt I realized that I may be able to write some code to solve Sudoku puzzles. I did so without using any for loops but with a lot of copying and pasting =) I couldn't believe my eyes when I ran the code and it was able to solve a medium level Sudoku puzzle. However, I was aware that my code was very inefficient, so I promised myself that I would implement what I learn to make it more efficient and have this as an ongoing side project to practice coding.

Gradually, I re-wrote the initial code with Python with for loops this time =) and made use of object-oriented programming as I became more confident with functions and obejcts.
