# sudoku_solvers
Attempting to solve Sudoku puzzles with three separate AIs

First AI: Translating some Sudoku solving techniques into code (SudokuHumanTechniques.py)
Second AI: Using a backtracking algorithm with Sudoku constraints (SudokuBactracking.py)
Third AI: Building a densely connected deep convolutional neural network (SudokuDenseNet.ipynb)

This as an ongoing side project to practice what I learn and explore how I can implement various AI methods to solve Sudoku puzzles.
